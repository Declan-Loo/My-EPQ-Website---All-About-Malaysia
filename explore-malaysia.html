							<h2 style="text-align: left">GUNUNG MULU NATIONAL PARK</h2>
							<p><strong>A UNESCO World Heritage Site located in Sarawak.</strong> Gunung Mulu National Park has limestone karst and massive cave formations. The site is surrounded by three mountains: Gunung Api, Gunung Benerat, and Gunung Buda, which are limestone mountains. Meanwhile, Gunung Mulu, which the site is named after, is a sandstone mountain. <br><br>The limestone was formed by the pressure of two crushing land plates for 20 million years and the deposition of rain and groundwater, respectively. The rainwater and groundwater caused limestone erosion, resulting in cave systems like chambers, underground rivers, and speleothems, only found in tropical areas. Gunung Mulu is also home to a variety of flora and fauna.</p>
