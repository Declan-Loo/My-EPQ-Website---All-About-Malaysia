# My EPQ Website - All About Malaysia

Hi! This is my website as part of my submission for the AQA Extended Project for October 2022. This website is about my country, Malaysia. This website has a lot of research about Malaysia. Unfortunately, I didn't really have much time to finish off the project nor have the features that I initially wanted to put in my website as part of my website design that I sketched prior to coding the website all by scratch using VSCode (Visual Studio Code). The project has been done in 90 hours, which includes research, planning, website development, artefact report and EPQ presentation. The title of the website is "All About Malaysia".

I hope you enjoy seeing the code and do let me know what to add in the future so I can improve my coding skills, and to see what other ideas I could have implemented in my website instead.
