                <h1>ABOUT PENANG</h1>
                <p>Penang is known as the Malaysian Food Capital. Penang is one of the best places to visit in Malaysia. Penang is located in northwest Peninsular Malaysia. It is an island along the Straits of Malacca, connected to the mainland by two bridges. Penang itself is also a state, but the state includes the island and the regions of the mainland known as Seberang Perai. It is known for having a rich historical and cultural status. It was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2008, along with Melaka. Around Penang, many hawker stalls sell tasty and cheap street food of various cuisines. Its architectural style is usually of a Chinese shophouse, even though its architecture is diverse.<br><br>
                    Penang was founded in 1786 by Captain Francis Light and was developed into a British trading hub. It soon overtook Malacca due to its free trade status, and it was quickly directly ruled by the British alongside Malacca and Singapore as the Strait Settlements in 1826.

                            <p>Cheong Fatt Tze constructed the mansion in the late 19th century, using the best materials worldwide. It is built in the style of traditional Chinese architecture because he wanted to show how beautiful that style is. He used the mansion to manage his business. When he died in 1916, the house fell apart. This resulted in restoration work in the mansion, which took six years and wasn't finished until 1995. Traditional Chinese methods were used to fix up the mansion so that its history would not be lost. It is still a well-known building in Penang, and it has been fixed up and turned into a boutique hotel. It is currently open to the public.
