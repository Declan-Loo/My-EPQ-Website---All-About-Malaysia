				<h1>ABOUT MELAKA</h1>
                <p>Malacca (Melaka in Malay) is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, along with Penang. It was founded in the late 14th century by Paramswera. Legend has said that Parameswara named the town Melaka after a tree he was leaning on. The founding gave rise to the Malacca Sultanate. During that period, a palace was built in Bukit Melaka, where Sultanate reigned over the region. Malacca became a trading port due to its strategic location along the Straits of Malacca. It was also the eastern end of the Indian Ocean trading routes. Resources like silk and porcelain from China, cloths from India, camphor from Borneo, nutmeg and cloves from the Moluccas, sandalwood from the East, and tin from Malaya, were available in Malacca.<br><br>
					However, the Portuguese invaded and colonised Malacca in 1511. They set their administrative centre at Bukit Melaka and constructed the now-called St. Paul’s Church and the fortress A’Famosa.<br><br>
					In 1641, the Dutch defeated the Portuguese in their conquest of Malacca and later colonised Malacca as the Dutch East Indies Company (VOC). As a result of the Anglo-Dutch Treaty, Malacca was officially handed over to the British in 1824, causing the start of British colonisation in Malacca. It would soon be directly ruled by the British as part of the Strait Settlements.

                            <p>A fort built by the Portuguese in 1512 to protect against attacks from Johor, those who followed Sultan Mahmud Shah, and the Acheh Sultanate. The only thing that is still standing is the Porta de Santiago, which is one of the main entrances to the fortress. During the Dutch rule, it would be refurbished. But the British blew up the fortress in 1807, leaving only the Porta de Santiago and a few houses around it standing, as they were worried about the Dutch’s influence in Malacca with the fortress present. At the time, the British were temporarily in charge of Malacca.

                            <p>Both A'Famosa and the church were built by the Portuguese on Bukit Melaka (Melaka Hill). The church was called “Nossa Senhora do Outeiro”, which meant Our Lady of the Hill. After the palace built by the Malacca Sultanate was destroyed, the fortress and church was constructed on that site. It used to be a Catholic church, but when the Dutch took over Malacca, it became a Protestant church. But the church was badly damaged, so it was rebuilt and given a new name: St. Paul's Church. The Dutch built the new Christ Church, so St. Paul's Church became a place where Dutch nobles were buried.
